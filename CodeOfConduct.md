# Code of Conduct

The organizers of **Perl and Raku Conference 2020** are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion (or lack thereof).

All participants (including attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers) at the conference are required to agree to the following code of conduct.
The code of conduct applies to all conference activities including talks, panels, workshops, and social events. It extends to conference-specific exchanges on social media, for instance posts tagged with the identifier of the conference (e.g. [#conference] on Twitter), replies to such posts, and replies to the official social media account (e.g. [@conference] on Twitter).

Organizers will enforce this code throughout and expect cooperation in ensuring a safe environment for all.

## Expected Behavior

All conference participants agree to:

* Be considerate in language and actions, and respect the boundaries of fellow participants.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and language. Please refer to Unacceptable Behavior for more details.
* Alert a member of the code of conduct response team [reference to further details] if you notice someone in distress, or observe violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. Please refer to the section titled [What To Do If You Witness or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior](what-to-do-if-you-witness-or-are-subject-to-unacceptable-behavior) for more details.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Behavior that is unacceptable includes, but is not limited to:

* Stalking
* Deliberate intimidation
* Unwanted photography or recording
* Sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events
* Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery or comments
* Offensive comments related to age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race or religion
* Inappropriate physical contact, which can include grabbing, or massaging or hugging without consent.
* Unwelcome sexual attention, which can include inappropriate questions of a sexual nature, asking for sexual favors or repeatedly asking for dates or contact information.

If you are asked to stop harassing behavior you should stop immediately, even if your behavior was meant to be friendly or a joke, it was clearly not taken that way and for the comfort of all conference attendees you should stop.
Attendees who behave in a manner deemed inappropriate are subject to actions listed under [Procedure for Code of Conduct Violations](#procedure-for-code-of-conduct-violations).

## Additional Requirements for Conference Contributions

Presentation slides and posters should not contain offensive or sexualized material. If this material is impossible to avoid given the topic (for example text mining of material from hate sites) the existence of this material should be noted in the abstract and, in the case of oral contributions, at the start of the talk or session.

## Additional Requirements for Sponsors

Sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment. In case of violations, sanctions may be applied without return of sponsorship contribution.

## Procedure for Code of Conduct Violations

The organizing committee reserves the right to determine the appropriate response for all code of conduct violations. Potential responses include:

* A formal warning to stop harassing behavior
* Expulsion from the conference
* Removal of sponsor displays or conference posters
* Cancellation or early termination of talks or other contributions to the program

Refunds may not be given in case of expulsion.
