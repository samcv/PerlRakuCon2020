Every year there is a Perl Conference in Europe. It has gone by many names, originally being called YAPC (Yet Another Perl Conference), a tongue in cheek naming which was more recently changed to
more clearly represent that this conference is the largest and premier Perl conference in Europe.


Due to the Perl 6 programming language renaming to Raku, this year the name has been changed to The Perl and Raku Conference or PerlRakuCon for short (PerlCon or RakuCon are also acceptable).
