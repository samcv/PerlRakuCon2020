# CANCELLED

Due to COVID-19, the organizers of the conference have agreed to cancel the event. For both safety as well as with the expectation that a new rule closing organized events over 3 people until June in the Netherlands has made the conferene this year untenable. The conference will continue in 2021 (likely to be in August just as this year was scheduled for). We are looking into the possibility of a remote conference sometime this summer in collaboration with the American conference.

# Papers

The Perl & Raku Conference is a high-quality, inexpensive, technical Conference that celebrates the family of Perl programming languages. The beauty of the conference is that it remains accessible to everyone regardless of experience, yet it is still valuable to the most skilled programmers.
